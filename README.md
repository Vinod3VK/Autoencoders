# Autoencoders: Teaching Machines to Reconstruct What Matters

**Project Type**: MSc Data Science – Individual Machine Learning Assignment  
**Topic**: Autoencoders – Compression and Denoising  
**Author**: Vinod Kumar Gera  
**Student Number**: 23111128

## Overview

This project explores the concept of **Autoencoders**, a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning. The focus is on building a basic autoencoder to compress and reconstruct MNIST digit images, followed by a **denoising autoencoder** to remove Gaussian noise from the images.
