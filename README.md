## 🔍 Overview

This project explores the concept of **Autoencoders**, a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning. The focus is on building a basic autoencoder to compress and reconstruct MNIST digit images, followed by a **denoising autoencoder** to remove Gaussian noise from the images.
